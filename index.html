            <h3> Pale Ale</h3>
            <p>
            Pale ale is an ale made with predominantly pale malt.
            The highest proportion of pale malts results in a lighter color. The term "pale ale" first appeared around 1703 for beers made from malts dried with coke, which resulted in a lighter color than other beers popular at that time. Different brewing practices and hop levels have resulted in a range of taste and strength within the pale ale family.

            <h3>Lager</h3>
            <p>
                Lager (German: storeroom or warehouse) (Czech: ležák) is a type of beer that originates from the part of the Austrian Empire that is now known as the Czech Republic. It is conditioned at low temperatures, normally at the brewery. It may be pale, golden, amber, or dark.Although one of the most defining features of lager is its maturation in cold storage, it is also distinguished by the use of a specific yeast. While it is possible to use lager yeast in a warm fermentation process, such as with American steam beer, the lack of a cold storage maturation phase precludes such beer from being classified as lager.

            <h3>Stout</h3>

            <p>
                Stout is a dark beer made using roasted malt or roasted barley, hops, water and yeast. Stouts were traditionally the generic term for the strongest or stoutest porters, typically 7% or 8%, produced by a brewery. There are a number of variations including Baltic porter, milk stout, and imperial stout; the most common variation is dry stout.

            <h3>Pilsner</h3>

            <p>
                Pilsner (also pilsener or simply pils) is a type of pale lager. It takes its name from Plzeň (Pilsen in Czech Republic), a city in Bohemia, then in the Austrian Empire, now in the Czech Republic, where it was first produced in 1842. The world’s first blond lager, the original Pilsner Urquell, is still produced there today.
